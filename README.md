# SIR-Model
In disease modelling, one of the basic models is called the SIR model. SIR stands for Susceptible, Infectious, and Recovered, which represent the different health states a person can be in with regard to an illness. 
A susceptible person is someone who is not sick, but can become sick. An infectious person is someone who issick and can infect others with the disease. A recovered person is someone who is no longer sick and hasdeveloped immunity to the disease. For this model, we will be assuming that the immunity is permanent.
